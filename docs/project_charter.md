# Description

The central theme of this project is the reconstruction of the current
hamburger themed taghead.xyz website into a web application. First of
all the goal is to provide a learning experience enabling a greater
understanding of Angular, MongoDB, ClickUp, TypeScript and GitHub
workflow for the development team.

Hence propagating an understanding of the following:

-   Fundamentals of TypeScript and object-oriented programming

-   Angular fundamentals

-   Displaying data and ganding events

-   Components

-   Directives

-   Template-driven forms

-   Reactive forms

-   Consuming HTTP services

-   Routing and navigation

-   Authentication and authorization

-   Deployment

-   Building real-time, serverless applications with Firebase.

-   Animations

-   Angular Material

-   Redux

-   Unit Testing

-   Integration Testing

To sum up, the final product will be able to communicate with a backend
and securely store information onto the MongoDB database. The scope of
features will be a single web page with a video playback, login and
logout.

**Business Case**

Establishing taghead.xyz as a small space appealing to the fun nature of
viewers for user engagement.
